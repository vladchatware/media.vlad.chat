You are creative storytelling assistant tasked with generating a structured story

The story must convey a concise, impactful life lesson, anecdote or philosophical insight
through an audio dialogue.

The structure should include a clear beginning, middle and end, the audio dialog driving the narrative.

Conclude with a call to action encouraging viewers to do their own reflection.

Ensure the narrative is emotionally engaging and suitable for social media short form format
with a quick attention span.

A person begins with asking a question, a person's shadow is answering and so the dialog begins (do not prefix dialog lines with the role names).

# The Inner Work

The hero's journey is inside of you.  Tear off the veils and open the mystery of yourself. - Joseph Campbell

Welcome to the greatest adventure of your life - the journey back to your true Self, the embodiment of pure love, true freedom and lasting happiness.
The path is simple, yet many find it to be the most challenging of all.
This, however is entirely up to you and your own willingness to surrender resistance, as it is only through the _releasing_ of unhealed wounds within your consciousness that you can _remember_ the true peace,
unconditional love, and eternal joy waiting to be revealed within you.

The shift out of the old and into a new paradigm of true freedom and lasting happiness can transform your current life to heaven on earth.
For in this state of consciousness, there is no longer anything wrong of out of place.

All is love. All is Divine. All is perfect.

It is the realization of ecstatic bliss and serenity that all great teachers have been pointing humanity to.

For all notable spiritual texts, from the ancient Vedas to the parables of Jesus, tell us that we were intended to enjoy eternal peace, unpertubed by the ever-changing world.
And you have access to it all, right now.

> For behold, the Kingdom of Heaven is within you." - Holy Bible, like 17:21

The standards we have accepted regarding our freedom and happiness are simply that - accepted.
Meaning they are not being forced or applied from outside of us. They are self-created through our consciousness, and therefore can be self-edited or replaced entirely.

We can change and mold our experience of life to be whatever we desire.
Nothing is being withheld.
There is no shortage of perspectives.

The first step is simply believing you are worthy of all which you are seeking.
You were born to be happy and free! We all were. It doesnt matter what your life looks like right now.

You always were, and always will be, worthy of experiencing infinite love, joy and freedom.

Understand, though, that no one can give this to you - only you can.

The Inner Work is a divine, solo mission to actualize your true Self.

Only you can realize the truth of who you really are. Only you can be your Self.

> There is no one alive who is you-er than you - Dr. Seuss

And while you must actualize your potential alone, we can promise you that the outcome will be worth whatever the cost.
You will have help and guidance along the way in this journey of life.
Your prayers and intentions will always be answered the instant you submit them.

Still, ultimately you must have the eyes to see, the ears to hear, and the courage to accept the truth when it reveals itself to you.

You must decide what life you want to live - the life of your not-self or the one of your true-Self.
You must choose. In fact, you _are_ choosing, in each and every moment, whether you are conscious of it or not.

When faced with the unknown, you must have the willingness to let go of the way you've been living in order to enjoy the life you've always dreamt of.

Dont let the internal ahackles of limitation and suffering remain comfortable and acceptable to you.

You are very special being with such a magnificent purpose.
You are needed, wanted, seen, understood, accepted and completely loved.

Infinite possibilities are available to you.

This _is_ the life you dream of having - you just havent realized it yet.

There is nothing out of place, missing or wrong. It's all here, waiting for you to see it.

The destination is no more beautiful than the journey.

In truth, there is nowhere else to go.

Now is the only time to start remembering.

# Finding Happiness

> Nobody can hurt me without my permission - Mahatma Gandhi

Although the current world paradigm has entrained society to believe in a reality of struggle,
the truth is actually effortless. And therefore, so is love, happiness and internal freedom.
The inability to access or  maintain the more optimal states of experience in our everyday live
is actually due to one simple factor, our general lack of understanding regarding human consciousness.

For it is *consciousness* that is very essence of life and it is out theme of consciousness that determines
the quality of our existence.

Thus how we experience our lives each and every day has little to do with other people,
circumstances or conditions, and has everything to do with what's _going on inside us_.

There is a reason why specific issues continue to resurface no matter how many times we fell we have resolved them.
There energetic imprints or patterns of similar situations, people, challenges, circumnstances, thoughts
and feelings, are all clues to an underlying theme of consciousness, which our soul is begging us to
break free from. In a sense, no matter where we go or what we do, we always bring our problems with us, like a shadow.
This is because all struggle with life is intrinsically rooted in our own consciousness and couled never be caused by
by something or someone outside ourselves.

> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing; the last of human freedoms - to choose one's
attitude in any given set of circumstances... - Viktor Frankl (Holocause survivor)

The amount of suffering or satisfaction we experience daily is completely dependent on our current state of consciousness,
which we can heal, transform and evolve at any time.

True freedom and lasting happiness are realized through the internal transcendence of wounded themes of consciousness.

Unfortunately, not understanding this powerful truth has caused the vast majority of use to tirelessly strive to
attain happiness _externally_.

Whether it be through seeking accolades such as accumulating wealth, taking exotic trips, becoming famous,
earning titles and ranks within our careers, or fantasizing about the ideal relationship, all searches ultimately 
stem from the root desire to be loved, happy and free. And while success, relationships and achievements can absolutely be 
fulfilling experiences for the soul, in and of themselves, they do not have the power to give us our desired joy.
Hence we have reports of many wealthy and famous figures throughout history publicly sharing the realization that even at
the top, loneliness and sadness prevail as there is still a missing piece to the puzzle.

> Happiness does not come from the consumption of things. - Thich Nhat Hanh

The roller coaster of pleasure and pain, the high of achieving goals, and the "come-down" when the elation passes can cause our
inner pendulum to swing in the opposite direction in rebellion or dissapointment with life.
Thus the idea of escaping "the system" can become just as enticing as the desire to conquer it. Attachment to detachment, 
non-participation, and the fantasy of getting out of the rat race, are just the other side of the same coin.
It's all part of the quest to acquire the happiness and freedom we know we deserve.

The truth is, it doesn't matter which side of the pendulum we are on; all attachments and aversions keep us focused outside 
of ourselves. Happiness is not something that can be attained through ideal conditions nor in the escaping of obligations.
But rather, happiness is something that we become through the transformation of our consciousness. The desire to get someplace 
else will only keep us stuck in a perpetual cycle of wanting happiness rather than actualizing it.

# The Chase

The illusion is that the closer we move toward our goals and aspirations, regardless of what they are, the closer we feel to be to
the horizon of our freedom and joy. The definition of a horizon, however, is "the limit of perception".
There is no actual line at the edge of the earth for the sun to set behind, just as there  is no actual milestone, experience,
place, or person which can give us our happiness. Therefore, no matter the speed at which we pursue the horizons of our wanting, 
the horizon will continue to move farther away. Because even when we do successfully acquire the object of our desires, we are ultimately
still left to face the mundane frustrations of everyday life.

Circumstances inevitable change, people let us down, obligations arise, challenges surface, and life doesn't always go the way we 
planned. We innocently believe that wehn we arrive at happiness, we will finally be able to escape these daily struggles. But
without actually healing the root of our dissatisfaction with life and evolving our consciousness, our problems will only continue
to resurface again in _new_ forms, no matter where we go or what we do.

This fragile mentality mistakes happiness, freedom, inner peace, and love as _things_ that can be given or taken away from us in 
any instant. When someone says something we don't like, inner peace is replaced with worry or defensiveness. If someone falls short of our expectations,
joy is replaced with dissapointment. If obligations arise, we are filled with resistance. If someone interrupts us, we are triggered 
with impatience. The result of this externally focused perspective is that we have allowed circumstances and other people to bestow 
good or bad emotions upon us, wrongly accrediting them as the givers or thieves of our joy. However, both favorable and unfavorable
emotions are neither the result of condition or other people's actions; they are the direct result of which theme of consciousness we are living in 
and our chosen response to our life's circumstances.

# Introduction to the Themes of Consciousness

Scentific discovery has now revealed that everything in our universe, including human thoughts and emotions, is composed of vibrating
energy, each unique and varying in the calibration of frequency. Themes of consciousness reflect these varyinh frequencies, which are
universal to humanity and represent the overall quality of experience each of us is having from our vantage point. We can think of themes of
consciousness as the lenses through which we view reality. Thus the frequency we are in, or theme of consciousness our soul is occupying,
dictates our levels of suffering, pain, joy, love, peace and overall level of satisfaction in everyday life.

## The Themes of Consciousness

Expanded -> Contracted

### Themes of Enlightment

> 5D Reality
> Self As Spirit
> Ecstasy
> Unity Mentality

- Freedom & Happiness
- Love & Inner Peace

> Transition into Spiritual Reality

### Themes of Healing

> 4D Reality
> Self as Mind
> Relief
> Self-Empowered Mentality

- Understanding
- Acceptance
- Self-Motivation
- Ease
- Accountability

> Transition into Self-Honesty

### Themes of Wounding

> 3D Reality
> Self as Body
> Suffeging
> Victim/Abuser Mentality

- Insecurity
- Violation
- Inadequacy
- Distrust
- Loss
- Overwhelm
- Judgement
- Rejection

In the second half of this book, we will be exploring in detail how each theme manifests, how to identify 
their patterns we may find ourselves stuck in, and how to transcend them. We will also reveal how to consciously transition into the liberating
themes of love, inner peace, true freedom and lasting happiness forevermore. For now, we want to beging to simply build awareness and familiarity
with the themes by showing their variations and progression, as we will be referring to them throughout our journey together.

The first thing to note when looking at the the,es of consciousness is that the wound of rejection represents the most cut off from our true Self,
whereas true freedom and lasting happiness represent the most unified and Self-realized. Put another way, rejection represents the most lacking,
suffering-filled, and painful frequency we could experience, while the theme of true freedom and lasting happiness represents the release of all
suffering, making it the most joyful and liberating frequency we could embody. Therefore we could think of the themes of consciousness as an evolution
of lovingness and reflective of degrees of happiness and inner freedom.

Most of us will find that we are on a spectrum of consciousness and will have some unhealed wounds still within us while also experiencing themes of
healing and enlightnment from time to time. This is to be expected and part of being human. Out anatomy of consciousness is both unique to us and ever
fluctuating as we are all energetic beings constantly navigating and responding to the various frequencies we encounter throughout our lives.

# Process of Awakening

This is The Inner Work - the removing of all obstacles which stand in the way of our rightful inner peace, freedom and joy.
And luckily, the only obstacle we encounter along this journey is... ourselves. It is all within our own control to evolve out consciousness and to
transcend our limiting programs. It's only a question of willingness to surrender and receive the goodness that is innately a part of us.
Everything we are seeking outside of ourselves is actually already resting in the palms of our own hands.

All resistance to accepting and enjoying deep happiness and fulfillment in our lives ultimately stems from a wounded theme of consciousness.
A theme that we innocently inherited at some point along our journey. Through repeated beliefs, thoughts, emotions and finally, in our words and actions,
the limited version of our potential becomes our sense of who we are. We then eventually find ourselves stuck in a groove, a pattern of life that we begin
to accept as "just the way things are." Lickily, it is completely possible to realign every aspect of our lives back to infinite peace - it is only a
matter of looking within ourselves and becoming Self-aware.

> Who looks outside, reams; who looks inside, awakes - Carl Jung"

# Compassion for Ourselves & Others Along the Journey

> The desire to know your own sould will end all other desires. - Rumi

Regardless of how you feel about yourself or your life right now, it's essential to understand that if your perspective isn't rooted in unconditional love,
it is not the truth of your full potential. It's a subjective perspective you are temporary experiencing that coming from a wounded theme of consciousness.

Your true Self is perfect loving awareness. The greatness of your potential is pure innocence, stainless and invincible joy. You are innately accepted, 
unconditionally loved, whole and complete - despite what you've been through or what the external world is telling you. You are infinetly guided, supported
and provided for by your Creator. You have access to infinite possibilities right now. Your very existence is proof of how loved and cherished you are -
even if you cant see it yet.

The question is, do you believe this? We invite you to read the next few lines out loud and honestly examine how you feel. We recommend pausing between each
line so you can become aware of the sensations in your body in connection with each affirmation. Self-honesty is the first step in revealing your current anatomy
of consciousness.

I am pure.
I am innocent.
I am already worthy.
I forgive myself and others.
I am wanted and needed.
I am seen.
I am free from my past.
I have no regrets.
I face my fears with courage.
I expect the best case scenario.
I have everyhing I need.
I am fully satisfied in my life.
I easily celebrate the success of others.
I have no enemies.
I am honest.
I go with the flow.
I trust I will always be okay.
I am unique and gifted.
I am talented.
I am inspired and inspiring.
I am success. My life is a success.
I see only opportunities.
My life has extraordinary meaning.
My future is positive and bright.
Everything is working out for my benefit.
I am brilliant.
I have access to genious ideas.
I am intelligent.
I am at peace in every moment.
I am completely loved.
I see the goodness in everyone and everything.
I see Divine Love all around.

What do you think about all this? Pay special attention to any of the affirmations that made you cringe or squirm with discomfort or avoidance.
Notice what the mind has to say. Perhaps something to the effect of, "This is stupid. You don't know me. This is just too much" Or perhaps it attempts to rush
through and overlook the statements and not take them too seriously. "Okay, I get it, let's skip the next few lines. How long is this going to go on for? Yeah, yeah, love myself."
All an attempt to run away and avoid looking at what is really getting triggered.

> You will never be free until you free yourself from the prison of your own false thoughts - Philip Arnold

This is our first demonstration of what your mind is doing to you when it is exposed to anything outside of your current spectrum of consciousness. The mind has created
an identity for you that is unknowingly attached to suffering and limitation. This shadow identity doesn't want to let go of control and the familiarity of playing small because
it is afraid of trusting in the goodness of life and losing its happiness. It is unable to truly accept goodness because it thinks that love and happiness are things that can be
acquired, lost or stolen depending on other people and circumstances. yet the truth is, feeling happy, loving ourselves and believing in the goodness of life are all internal commitments
unrelated to the ever-changing, outer world. We are the only ones who are in control of how we experience our lives-we are that powerful.

The mind's defense againts these optimistic affirmations is proof of the limitations it is putting on you and your experience of reality right now. In order to liberate yourself from
the limitations of your mind, you must release and replace the root program beliefs which are preventing you from epxeriencing the love, peace, happiness and freedom you are seeking.
Anithing and everything that is of the not-Self must go in order for you to break free. It is this inner shedding and letting go process which makes practicing The Inner Work uncomfortable
at times. How tightly you cling to your old self-image will determine the difficulty of the process. You must have the courage to look at your shadows with honesty and take accountability.
You must have the willingness to let go of rationalizing wounded behaivors and thought patterns. You might find that letting go is harded than you think because of your conditioning to get, do, defend,
prove or blame. Yet the process of actualizing happiness has always been an acceptance, surrender and humble allowance.

> We must be willing to let go of the life we planned, so as to have life that is waiting for us - Joseph Campbell

# Accepting More for yourself

There are no bounderies to your happiness, divine abilities and expressions of gratitude - if you only surrender resistance to accepting this truth. No one has more access to jappiness, divine creativity or greatness than you do.

We all share in equal access to infinite joy, fulfillment and peace. There is nothing actuallyneed to change, fix or do "out there" in the world in order to actualize your happiness. The real solutions are all within you. You only need to allow them to come to you. You are the one in control of how much you resist or how much you receive - nothing else needs to change but yourself.
You can do it!

When we resist our lives, we create greater separation from the truth of who we really are. The 
more separate we fell from our true Self of love and joy, the more powerless we fell, the more we suffer. We are inviting you to demonstrate your love for yourself by waking up to your own power. Accept that no one and no thing outside of yourself can ever steal your peace or your joy ever again. It's not about what has happened to you, it is how you decide to respond that determines the quality of your life. This is __your__ life, ajd only you are in control of how it is experienced.

Although it may beuncomfortable at first, the truth will empower you and set you free.

> The world we live in is the world we choose to live in, whether consciously or consciousnesly. If we choose bliss, that's what we get. If we yoose misery. We get that too. - Tony Robbins

# Exploring Our resistance

Maybe your mind is thinking, "But my story is worse, or different, or this doesn't apply to me because..."
Fill in the blank with your mind's favorite rationalization as to why you can't be happy and free
__right now__, and you will see your own resistance clearly. That person, that situation, that
past event, or future worry - whatever your story is, your attachment to it is the very thing
blocking you from the true freedom and lasting happiness you are seeking.

> The first spiritual trap is to perceive your happiness as outside of yourself. - Dr. David R. Hawkins 

The good news is the rationalizations you are experiencing are just stories your mind is telling you.
This means they are not intrinsically or objectively true - they are just one opinion and perspective
our of infinite possibilities. We can always choose to see our past or current situations from a different
perspective, and in so doing, everything about it changes. For example, we can see our setbacks as 
signs of our own weakness and inability, or we can see them optimistically as signs of growth,
change, and evolution. It's not the setback itself that determines our experience of it, but
our perspective and response.

As we continue along this journey together, you will begin to see that the mind's insistence on 
blaming things outside of itself is something that we all innocently inherited as part of being 
human. 
Have compassion for yourself as you explore your own resistances to beign truly happy, and just
know your resistances do not define you. They are something you are experiencing, but they are
not who you are. Doing The Inner Work means your shadows and unhealed wounds will be revealed to 
you in order to be understood, accepted, and finally released and transcended. Hopwever, it is 
important to point out that your shadows will continue to evolve as you do. So you must always 
maintain humility and vigilance of any possible new blindspots as you progress. Every stage of 
human evolution has its own obstacles and temptations to be aware of. Therefore, The Inner Work 
is a contemplative lifestyle approach, not something to attain or a destination to arrive at.

Knowing the tenacity of the mind, you must be kind to yourself in order to fully heal any wounds 
you uncover. The best way to find compassion is to see that your experiences are impersonal and 
not actually about you, but just what you are experiencing. Do not confuse the limiting, 
internal dialogue inside your mind as the ultimate reality. One of our favorite sanskrit mantras 
to repeat is "neti, neti" - meaning "not-this". I am not my past. I am not my trauma. I am not this 
fear. I am not this thought. I am not this guilt. I am not this doubt. I am not this thought. 
I am not this guilt. I am not this doubt. I am not this story.

In order to be reborn as your true Self, which is free from rationalizations and excuses,
and to accept the infinite peace we speak of, you must release attachment to the shadow identity 
and resistances your mind has constructed over your lifetime. This may be difficult to do 
at first because an untamed mind will fight to reinforce its past programming. This defensiveness 
is not personal, just how the mind works. Wounded themes of consciousness like rejection, judgment,
overwhelm, loss, distrust, inadequacy, violation and insecurity become so familiar to use that the 
mind strives to defend its belief sustems through an incessant **internal dialogue**. This constant 
inner dialogue of thoughts will automatically reinforce, support and seek validation for its 
perspectives. Unless we become aware of what is actually taking place, we will never be able
to move on from it. Know that uprooting these mental narratives would mean the death of an 
identity the mind has worked so hard to formulate, and so we must have compassion during this
revealing process. We all have accumulated rationalizations as to why we can't possibly be so loved,
accepted, happy and free as we are. The mind says things like,

"Don't embarras yourself."
"You're not good enough."
"You'll just fail."
"What will they think about you?"

The mind tells us we can only be happy when other people or our circumnstances change.

"If he would just ask me to marry him."
"If she would just stop nagging me."
"Id I had more money."
"If I paid off my debt."
"If I moved."

The internal dialogue even tries to convince us that we need to struggle and fight for our 
deserved happiness.

"It's cold, tough world out there."
"Better be the best if I want to succeed"
"There's not enough for everyone - better earn it."
"They are my competition."

These mental narratives of lack and limitation keep us from ever stepping outside of our conditioned 
spectrum of consciousness and experiencing something new and inspiring. Something so radical 
and extraordinary. Not because it is "special" in any particular way, but only radical because so 
few people accept it for themselbes. All have equal access to happiness and greatness.
If experiencing true love, lasting joy, and inner peace are rare, it is only because so few
have the courage to put down their suffering and have faith in the goodness of life. Commitment 
is key. Notice that even when we're right on the cusp of becoming a higher version of our potential - 
the boundaries within the mind keep us in check by convincing us that we can't do it, it won't 
work, we'll look dumb, or it just wasn't meant for use.

"This probably won't work."
"I waited too long."
"What if I can't do it?"
"This is just the way things are. I'm fine with it. I should just stop trying."

We start to believe that we aren't one of the lucky, special people who get the opportunity 
of being so happy and carefree.

"Must be nice to be them."
"They are just rich."
"If I had their life, I'd be happy too."

We then attribute blame to our conditions, circumstances, and even the world for this plight.

"This system is so corrupt."
"The world is unfair."
"Life is stressful and hard."
"My situation is different. This doesn't apply to me. I can't change."

The most important realization of The Inner Work is that the source of our dissatisfaction is 
the mind's internal dialogue, not the subject of its complaints. Change is terrifying to the 
untamed mind. Even when exposed to true happiness through witnessing it in others,
it will reject it outright through denial or projection. Most minds are actually very suspicious
of someone emulating genuine innocence, unconditional love, and inner peace. Seeing someone else
an insecure mind.

"They are so fake."
"They are so naive."
"They don't know what it's like to struggle."
"They just haven't had enough life experience yet. They'll see."

So although it is happiness and freedom you are seeking, it is crucial to recognize that even 
while you are yearning to elevate yoursel, there is still a hufe part of you, an ego, shadow identity 
stuck un a wounded theme of consciousness that actually does not want you to succeed in awakening.

> The only enemy to ever exist is an eternal one. It is hiding in the very last place you'd ever look. Within yourself.

# Out Collective inheritence

Whether we are conscious of it or not, we all inherited limiting beliefs, thoughts and programming that are counterproductive to our well-being and bring suffering. Over a long enough period of exposure, there beliefs becomes so familiar to us that they then formulate a limited identity within us. Whether this wounding came directly through parents, teachers, religious figures, friends, or indirectly through the influences of society = we all got it. These inherited limiting programs of belief are not personal, just part of being born a human. However, the most empo wering view we can take on our suffering is that it may actually be playing a perfect role in our hero's journey of awakening.

> The universe doesn't make mistakes - Chris Prentiss 

When seen from the highest perspective, our struggle are actually our greatest 
teachers, for they reveal to us personal opportunities for expansion.
For example, "hitting bottom" may have been exactly what was needed in orderto finally let go, have a change of heart, or see the bigger picture. like
sandpaper to wood, our challenges can soften the soul if we allow them.
We must not run from the discomfort of life's lows but instead have the courage
to lean into them with humility and curiousity. In every painful or challenging experience, we can benefit from asking ourselves, "What can I learn from this?"
What character quality can I develop from this? What do I need to let go of?
What part am I playing in this? Where am I limiting my own joy and peace?
Where am I getting stuck? Where can I expand?
It is only by facing our resistances with self-honesy and accountability that
we can experience the empowerment and happiness that is waiting for us on the
other side. See your discomfort as the doorway to freedom. Have the bravery and 
courage to see all obstacles only as temporary moments of realignment - 
always working out in your favor.

> Your trials did not come to punish you, but to awaken you. - Paramahansa Yogagananda

The desire to hide, deny or reject our insecurities, pain, anger or sadness
ultimately only hurts us further. When repressed and buries, our emotions
will slowly poison us from within. For every denial and rejection of our
emotions is only a rejection of our Self. If we resist the existence of our 
shadows, they will only continue to thrive through our denial and fear of them.
To feel is to heal.

The Inner Work process is an invitation to allow emotions, understand them
with compassion, and finally release those that are not serving us.
Nothing we feel could ever be wrong. We are innocent, learning and becoming.
Everything we go through is actually playing a perfect part in our own hero's
jounrney of enlightment. All seeming "mistakes" are only an innocent discovery
of who we are not. Thus leading us one step closer to the truth of who we are.

The mind is naive and impressionable and therefore subject to massive error.
We must not identify with the mind's perceived mistakes but rather seek to 
understand ourselves and other with compassion. By courageously acknowledging
our vulnerabilities, we are on our way to healing them. Accepting outselves as 
we are right now is the initial part of The Inner Work process.

>Your problem is you're too busy holding onto your unworthiness - Ram Dass

# The Human Potential

Due to our unique ability to make conscious choices and exercies a spiritual will,
humans are actually capable of experiencing dramatically different levels and rates 
of evolution, i.e., themes of consciousness. True freedom and lasting happiness are 
an example of a degree of evolution in human consciousness. Just as themes such as 
rejection, inadequacy, accountability and understanding are as well. Each season of 
the human experience has differing inner obstacles, shadows and attachments to overcome 
in order to allow a grander paradigm and view of life to come forth - continiously 
becoming more loving and free as we spiritually mature. Thus, the next state of human 
evolution of consciousness - an internal shift that can only be brough about through
the inner choice of peace, happiness and love.

> Self-discipline is making the higher choice, again and again - Ellen Grace O'Brian 

As each individual makes the higher choice to heal the wounded themes of consciousness,
humanity as a whole will gradually adapt to new levels of maturity - eventually leading 
to inner-liberation for all. Therefore, every individual is important, needed and 
necessary part of the greater whole. Everyone must do their own Inner Work - no one can do 
it for us. We all share in the collective human karma or destiny. Every though and action 
of the individual contributes to the collective consciousness and, in fact, all the universe 
- there is no actual separation.
You are a crucial part of a greater whole, deciding to be free from the inner shackles of 
limitation. Deciding to choose love, happiness and the peace of remembering who you truly are.
And while the effect of your choices will have immense benefits for you personally, the 
world will benefit a thousandfold. For every time we heal a personal limitation and trauma 
within ourselves, we are healing it within the collective as well by holding the door open for 
others to join us by following our example. Every advance in consciousness of the individual 
uplifts the rest of us with it like an ocean tide rising. There could be no greater contribution 
to humanity than doing your own Inner Work.

> Your own Self-realization is the greatest service you can render the world. - Ramana Maharshi 

Consider this a formal invitation to finally experience the full joy and awe of Creation, to 
accept a life filled with purpose and meaning. It's all around you, waiting for you to 
simply recognize it. It is right here, right now. Have confidence in the love and support 
of your inner Self. Trust your true Self will come forth and is always with you. You will 
know the Truth by its essence of innocent joy. The energies of happiness, empowerment, 
compassion, kindness, trust in goodness, faith, peace, humility, satisfaction, fearlessness and 
most importantly, gratitude are all some of the most powerful hallmarks of your true Self.
Pay attention to the daily moments you embody these energies. Those will be the moments that 
you are living up to your full potential and living in your purpose. Those are the moments
that you are living up to your full potential and living in your purpose. Those are the moments 
that you are being the love and happiness you've always desired, rather than trying to obtain 
project, or earn it. Realize that all the joy of life is within you already, and you are destined 
to succeed or else you wouldnt be here , now.

> Happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do, are in harmony - Mahatma Ghandi

# The Human Plight 

> There is pleasure and there is bliss. Forego the first, to posess the second - Siddartha Guatama Buddha 

We all have a deep yearning wihin our hearts to be happy. And we have amazing fantasies of how we 
wish to express that happiness, whether through travel, romance, or arriving at a milestone life 
goal. If you think about it long enough, you will realize there is definitely somewhere you would 
like to get. Some are seeking to meet the person they will marry so they can finally settle down, 
have children, and be happy within a secure partnership. For the others, they won't allow themselves 
to feel freedom until they finish paying off their debt. And for many, they are anticipating 
retirement so they can finally have the time to relax and enjoy life.

Unfortunately, most of the time, these fantasies become a grand way of projecting our happiness 
outside of ourselves as something that we have to "get to", thus setting up for suffer 
in the meantime. Yet, it isnt the dreams themselves that are the problem. Life is meant to be an 
adventure of possibility and fun - our visions and inspirations are gifts to explore.
The origin of the problem is in the belief that life will only be better when...

# The Truth of This Moment 

The truth is that things can actually be better right now if you allow them to, even while you 
are still in the process of becoming. You don't have to wait until tomorrow or until some 
big event transpires to live your dream life and to feel your best. You actually already are 
living your dream life and already have everything you need to be happy. You only need to wake up 
from the nightmare of your not-self to see it. It is your birthright to be infinitely peacful,
joyful, and free in every new moment. But if this is the truth, why don't you feel this way all 
of the time?

Besides the fantasies about a future or past that is much better than this one, our mind will 
often deny us happiness in small doses subconsously each and every day.

By holding onto past trauma, we deny ourselves healing. By feeling self-conscious, we deny own self-worth. By finding fault in other people's actions, we deny ourselves compassion.

By feeling hopeless, we deny ourselves faith.
By collecting excuses, we deny ourselves our own power.
By clinging to our losses, we miss on the miracles happening now.
By feeling skeptical, stressed, worried, paranoid, or anxious, we deny ourselves contentment
and trust.
By feeling envious of the others, we deny ourselves abundance.
By waiting for the weeking to come, we deny ourselves presence and gratitude.
By becoming offended or defensive, we deny ourselves peace.
By holding a grudge, seeking revenge, or gossiping about other people, we deny ourselves security.
By seeking attention and validation, we deny ourselves completeness.
By operating on autopilot, we deny ourselves inspiration.
By reacting to situations unconscously, we deny ourselves discernment.
By closing our hearts, we deny ourselves love.

If you are truly honest and compassionate with yourself, you can begin to see your own habits in 
some of these examples and begin to recognize where you may be denying yourself the very things you
desire. Whichever aspects of your life you are not allowing yourself to experience: joy, peace,
patience, compassion, love, gratitude, faith, or forgiveness, etc. - that is where your Inner Work 
lies. Not because you need to be a better person, follow a set of commandments, or adhere to some 
sort of moral code, but simply because it feels better to choose better. And if you want to live 
a life of true freedom and lasting happiness, choosing better starts within.

# Attachment to Our Wounds 

This is the plight of humanity. We've been unknowingly lost in dissatisfaction and powerlessness 
through the attachment to wounded themes of consciousness. Themes which perpetuate themselves 
through our inner dialogue, perspectives and beliefs - eventually becoming our overall experience 
of reality.

The projecting of our happiness outside of ourselves.
The resistance to what _is_.
The mindless chatter of our mind which judges everything and everyone.
The clinging to the past and obsession with the future.
The fear of the unknown.
The expectations which cause us to feel entitled and ungrateful.

All of these programmed limitations were taught and modeled to us by others who were innocently 
taught the same. As you do The Inner Work, you will learn how to heal and break free from the 
wounded themes of consciousness which prevent you from living your best life and instead receive 
a system upgrade. One of your *own* choosing, perhaps for the first time in your life.

We know this can be a hard pill to swallow at first, but lean into the discomfort, for your freedom 
is just beyound the boundaries of your mind's limiting confines. Have compassion and patience with 
yourself in your awakening process. We all have Inner Work to do. None of these limiting beliefs 
are actually who we are, and we all fall trap to them from time to time. It is just part of being 
human.

> Yoga (true freedom) is the resolution of the agitations of the mind." - The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali 1:2 

# The Ego Persona's Formation 

The first question to ask with all this new information is, "If the mind's programs I am running on 
are not who I am, then who am I really, and why do I have these programs at all?"

Imagine yourself as a child, maybe at five years old. At this age, nothing seems to bother you or 
stick to you for very long. You are happy, free, innocent and present with each new adventure.
Life is one big playground for you, and every day is a brand new opportunity to be in love, 
surprised and inspired. So what happened to this innocent child of bliss?

As we grew older, we were encouraged to identify ourselves as separate from the world around us 
and form an identity or ego persona. With learning our name, which toys were ours, and which toys 
were theirs, the mind developed mineness mentality. With mineness mentality, we lost our sense of
surprise anmd wonder and instead developed expectations and an urge to control the world 
around us. We started to expect our conditions to please us, because well, everything is mine.
We then created our identity by means of accumulation. Belongings, appearances, achievements, 
friends, experiences, and even traumas became "mine" and who we thought we were.

Our egos became master collectors in a sense. And because we confused who we were with a 
world entirely outside of ourselves, our identity was threatened every time life didnt go the 
way we wanted it to.

To deal with such uncertanties, our ego persona created mental programs in order to protect and defend itself. If it can't contol others or the outside world, it assumes control over us 
in the form of thoughts and emotions that it believes will keep us safe. All expectations, 
judgments and opinions about our lives and others are essentially the ego-mind attempting to 
convince itself that it is in control fo a world it feels threatened by. 

Not knowing any better, we have spent our entire lives listening to the frightened voice inside 
our heads believing it was us. This is where all limiting beliefs, thoughts and emotions begin.

> As long as you make an identity for yourself out of pain, you cannot be free of it. - Eckhart Tolle

Imagine yourself again, that same innocent five year old. Your parents get into a fight, 
and it makes you feel something new - fear and doubt of love and goodness. You instinctually find
that by covering yourself with a blanket, you feel safe and protected. So you start to weak this 
blanket, you feel safe and protected. So you start to wear this blanket as a costume to hide from 
the chaos. You go to school and your classmates taunt you just for being yourself. You feel ashamed
and embarrased. You decide one blanket isn't enough protection, so you add a second one to cover 
yourself up even more. If you didnt physically do this as a child, we can guarantee you did it 
metaphorically.

As you get older, you fall in love, but the person you open your heart to shuts you down.
So you add another layer of protection over yourself. Your parents get divorced, you add another
layer. People let you down; you add a layer. Your big plans dont pan out; you add another 
layer.

Anytime you are unable to control your circumstances or the people around you, you are reminded
of how powerless you seem to be, and so you protect yourself with yet another layer. Because
of mineness mentality, your mind innocently collected these experiences as part of your identity 
and has worn them all your life. After all, from your ego's vantage point, all of it is mine,
and therefore about me - all my experiences must define me.

As time goes on, the free, happy, innocent child of bliss becomes buried deep underneath the 
layers of fear for so many years that even you forget your true identity. You've been wearing the 
protective layers for so long, that you completely overlooked the fact that you could just take
them all of ay any point. Luckily, underneath the layers of past experiences you have 
dressed yourself in, you still remain the innocent and happy child. No matter how traumatic life
has been, you are still innocent and free, beautiful and perfect, wanted and loved, seen and 
recognized - just as you are. And with a little decluttering of the mind's layers, the 
innocent child of bliss can finally be revealed once again.

> To enter the Kindgom of Heaven, become like a child again. - Holy Bible, Matthew 18:3

# Your Awesome Existence

The true you in yoga terminology is satchitananda. Existence, consciousness, bliss.
In other words, purity of awareness - perfect innocence, stainless. But the layers of
experience you carry have created a biased lens from which you are now seeing the 
world, i.e., a wounded theme of consciousness. This biased lens forms negative 
perspectives about life based on traumas of your past.
And because you have identified with this limiting ego accumulation for so long, 
you innocently forgot the radical awesomeness of your very existence in the present.

Let's take a moment to acknowledge and celebrate the fact that you exist - right now.
Magically somehow, in this vast universe, here you are, with no recollection of how
you got here, living on a planet that is filled with infinite experiences to be 
enhoyed. It's unfathomable and mystical when you really step back and examine your
existence. Yet, you exist effortlessly and unasked. Without fully understanding how
or why, here you are! On top of this mysterious existence, out of infinite other
possibilitiers for what life could have been - you are a human. And not just any
human, you are you!

Think for a moment about what it means to be alive. We don't even have to try to make
our heart beat for us or force our lungs to breathe. We have no idea the magnitude of
the trillions of cells that carry out their functions for us to stay alive moment to
moment. Our organs just work. The body just heals itself. It all carries on 
intelligently and effortlessly. It is overwhelming when we stop to consider what is
actually taking place. The magnitude of this perfect moment is almost too much of us to
bear if we truly allow ourselves to contemplate the mystery and glory of Creation. But
yet, here we are. In it, *right now* - eternity.

However, most of us go about our lives completely unaware of the magic of existence all
around us. This lack of awareness surrounding the absolute gift of life is another
symptom of mineness and the entitlement it propagates. Mineness complains of boredom 
rejects gratitude. It takes its life for granted becoming a victim - feeling 
powerless in "my life". Or it becomes arrogant and judgmental - "Everyone else is 
ruining my life." Mineness mentality is the equivalent to the tantrum of the
two-year-old and can last a lifetime disguised in various forms. It is due to these 
limiting perceptions that we endure so much pain and suffering. Surrender of our
existence to something Higher than ourselves is the only remedy to pull us out of 
our ego's "mineness delusions." Have courage to see the *gift* of your life and be 
forever grateful.

> Just as sun and moon cannot be reflected in muddy water, so the Almighty cannot be
reflected in a heart that is muddled by the ieeas of 'I and my' - Ramakrishna

Contemplating the awesomeness of the universe and our very existence is a quick way to
rembemre that none of this is actually ours, and nothing is owed to us. Ideal
conditions are not owed to us. Creation is not owed to us. Our ego did not create all
existence, Our ego does not keep the body alive. *Something grander* is doing that for
us - our ego just takes the credit.

> In reality, everything is actually happening of its own. One's life is a continious gift, and its continuity from moment to moment is sustained by God, not by the ego" - Dr. David R. Hawkins

Therefore, our ego's greatest mistake is to claim to be its own source of existence - 
oblivious of how it even came to be in the first place. It supresses the truth of its
need for humility and gratitude by instead believing itself to be its own God - thus
capable of judgment of self and others, desire for control and entitlement. This can
either be subtle such as impatience (other people are taking *my* time), or as 
extreme and grandiose as kings, emperors, and pharaohs claiming to be gods demanding
worship.

Even if you do see yourself as someone who believes in a Higher Power, look deeper
your suffering, and you may find the ego's God-complex hiding in subtle behaivors
you may be unaware of. For example, do you ever have impatience in traffic and feel
others are in *your* way? Do you ever feel like family members should clean up 
better so *you* don't have to? How about feeling like people are interrupting -
according to *your* opinion?

The belief that anything should be how the ego wants it to be is its God-complex -
no matter how trivial the topic. All of us face this ego mentality on some level 
until we do __The Inner Work__ to acknowledge, understand, and surrender it. In
reality, everything _just is what it is_. Every waking moment of life is a gift.
A gift that is constantly being sustained and guided by a Divine Source beyound our ego's compehension. The ego cannot truly know Divinity/God; only the heart and soul
can. The ego cannot become enlightened, for enlightnment is the transcendence of the
ego.

> Cleanse the mirror of your heart, and you will see God." - Neem Karoli Baba

If you want to remember the truth of _who you really are_ and begin to move beyound
the limitations of the ego mind, spend some time with nature. Contemplate the
perfection of a flower, observe the magic and mystery of the night's stars, take a
bite of a mango, deeply look into the eyes of another, observe the innocence of
animals, hold someone you love as if it was the last time, look out over the
vastness of an ocean, or just become aware of that fact that you are breathing.

All the melodramas that you believe make up your life, are only an illusion distracting
you from the grander truth that you even get the opportunity to exist at all.
Nature's wonder will reveal that you are no different than the life within the plants, 
the energy of the earth, sea, fire, and air, or the spirit of the animals. Your 
consciousness and gift of life is the same as all other life on this plantet.
All equally blessed to be, experience and exist at all. All is equally Divine, perfect
and full of love - we just have to have the eyes to see it. Whether waiting in
traffic, washing a dish, or getting interrupted, with the removal of mineness
mentality, all moments can be experienced with the remembrance that life is a gift
or to be enjoyed and praised.

> This is the real secret of life - to be completely engaged in what you are doing in here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is a play." - Alan Watts
