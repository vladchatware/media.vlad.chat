# Social Media Engine

This app generates short videos around specific content that is specified in
the prompt.

## Running the Remotion editor

Run the Remotion Studio to browse and tweak the compositions:

```bash
npm run studio
```

The editor opens at http://localhost:3000. Use the left sidebar to pick a composition, adjust props, and preview the result. The render queue is available from the top-right corner.

If you still need to run the Next.js API routes, use:

```bash
npm run next
```

and open http://localhost:4000 to access the media builder UI. API routes remain available at http://localhost:4000/api.
