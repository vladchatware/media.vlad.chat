    {
      "text": "Why does every achievement feel like sand slipping through my fingers? I thought success would make me whole—why doesn't it?",

      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Because you've been chasing a horizon that will forever recede. You run toward a picture of worth you learned to believe in, not the worth that lives inside you.",
      "instructions": "calm, low, patient; steady rhythm; slight echo, as if a shadow speaking from behind",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "So it's all just a lie? Everything I've worked for—money, praise, approval—it's meaningless?",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Not meaningless. Useful. But small. They can decorate a life, not create it. They satisfy for a moment because they distract you from a deeper hunger: the hunger to be seen, safe, and loved within yourself.",

      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"

      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Begin where you are. Sit with one ache behind your wanting. Ask: 'What do I expect this success to give me?' Wait for the first honest answer—no fixes, no solutions—just notice.",

      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"

      "text": "I tried that once. I heard: 'I want to feel worthy.' It felt embarrassingly small and huge at the same time.",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "There it is—the wound. Worthiness is not a trophy to win; it's a relationship to heal. Your shadow—what you call lack—shows up to protect you with patterns: hustle, comparison, perfectionism.",

      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"

      "text": "Invite it in. Name the fear. Thank it for trying to keep you safe. Then ask it what it needs to stop shouting. The shadow isn't the enemy—it is the scared child carrying a strategy that once worked. Meet it with curiosity, not punishment.",

      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "That loosened grip is the sign. When success stops being the solution and becomes an expression, you work from fullness, not from lack. Then achievements serve you; they don't define you.",

      "side": "right",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Exactly. The journey to the prize is inward. Tear off the veils—tend the wounds—and success becomes a companion, not a master. Keep practicing the small acts: notice, name, welcome, breathe. The rest will follow.",
      "instructions": "clear, final, resonant; a quiet bell-like tone to close",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },

      "text": "Thank you. I'll start by asking the question you gave me—what do I expect this to give me—and I'll sit with the answer without fixing it.",

      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "If this touched you, pause and ask yourself that same question. Share in the comments one honest answer you discover—no judgment, only curiosity. Let's build a space where the chase becomes a conversation with ourselves.",
