    {
      "text": "Shadow... why do you feel so big and scary inside me?",
      "instructions": "Voice: young boy, nervous curiosity, soft inhale at start, tentative pace, rising intonation at end.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Because I've been carrying the hurts you couldn't hold — I grew to protect you from feeling them again.",
      "instructions": "Voice: deep, calm, patient, low steady pace, warm timbre, gentle reassurance.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "But I don't want to be afraid of myself anymore. How do I make you small?",
      "instructions": "Voice: frustrated then hopeful, quicker words turning to slow, searching tone.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Not small — known. When you stop fighting and look with kind eyes, I stop shouting for attention.",

      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "It might. Pain is the doorway, not the prison. Breathe into it, listen without judgment, and you'll find the story beneath the alarm.",

    {
      "text": "How do I even begin? I get lost in the panic and run away.",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Begin with one breath. Name one feeling: scared, lonely, ashamed. Say it softly. When attention meets a wound, the wound loosens — curiosity is a kind healer.",
      "instructions": "Voice: clear, precise, gentle urgency, slight upward inflection on the instruction.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"

    {
      "text": "So choosing to stay is actually how I get free? That sounds impossible and brave at once.",

      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes. Choice is the smallest brave act with the biggest ripple. Each time you choose presence instead of hiding, the shadow shifts from enemy to teacher.",

      "voice": "ash"

      "voice": "onyx"

    {
      "text": "You won't erase me — you will learn to dance with me. Freedom isn't absence of shadow; it's walking with it without letting it lead.",

      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },

      "text": "I want to try. I'll breathe and invite whatever is there to be seen.",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Good. Start now: breathe once, name one feeling, and say, 'I see you.' That tiny ceremony wakes peace more than you think.",
      "instructions": "Voice: whisper-to-encourage, intimate, soft but clear, slow and deliberate.",

      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "Try it for one minute. Notice what changes, then share what you felt in the comments — your small witnessing might awaken someone else.",
