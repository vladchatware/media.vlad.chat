      "text": "Give yourself an absurd deadline—something that sounds impossible. It’s less about the time and more about forcing your brain to start.",

      "text": "Yes. Say the report will be done in ten minutes. Your perfectionist brain freezes when there's infinite time—an absurd deadline breaks that loop.",
