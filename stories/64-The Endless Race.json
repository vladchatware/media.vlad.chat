      "text": "Because you are running toward a horizon that moves with your wanting. The world teaches you to chase; your shadow teaches you to look.",

      "text": "Showing up is the alchemy. You're not repairing a broken self; you're remembering the parts of you you left behind. As you integrate them, joy becomes less conditional and more present. The race quiets.",
