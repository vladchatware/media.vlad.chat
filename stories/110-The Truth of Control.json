      "text": "Because somewhere along the way you learned control is safety — your shadow learned to hold the wheel so you wouldn't fall. It's a protection, not the truth of who you are.",

      "text": "That panic is the echo of an old wound — rejection, abandonment, a time you felt small. Control promises you won't feel that again, so it tightens its grip.",

      "text": "Start by turning toward the grip with curiosity, not force. Talk to the part of you that wants to control — ask it what it's protecting you from and listen without shame.",

      "voice": "onyx"

      "text": "There — that memory is the root. The inner work isn't about erasing the shadow; it's about healing the wound that taught it to grab the wheel. When the wound feels seen, the shadow relaxes.",
