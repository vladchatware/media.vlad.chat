      "text": "Why do I keep getting frustrated, even when I try so hard to do things right? It feels like I'm chasing something I never reach.",

    {
      "text": "Because you're chasing a horizon — the idea that some outside thing will finally make you okay. I'm the part of you that keeps pointing out what's missing. In myth, they call me the shadow.",

      "voice": "onyx"

    {
      "text": "Not an enemy. A wounded messenger. Frustration is an alarm bell — not to punish you, but to show you an old wound, an unmet need, a belief that keeps replaying.",

      "text": "Two simple steps: notice, then befriend. First, when the heat rises — pause and name it. Second, ask the shadow what it's protecting you from and offer kindness instead of punishment.",

    {
      "text": "Yes. Try: three deep breaths, quietly say ‘I feel angry / disappointed / small,’ and then ask, ‘What do you need?’ You might hear: ‘I need to be seen,’ or ‘I fear being rejected.’",

      "text": "You respond differently. Thank it for trying to keep you safe. Offer what it needs — a kind word to yourself, a boundary, a small action. Over time the alarm quiets because the wound is being known, not ignored.",

      "side": "right",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes. The freedom isn't a destination out there — it's the choice you make in the moment. Try this now: three breaths, name one recurring frustration, and ask your shadow what it needs. Then share what you notice below — your words might help someone else start their inner work.",
