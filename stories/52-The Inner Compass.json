    {
      "text": "Listen first — I'm speaking now because I used to be loud inside you. I am your shadow: the hurried part that protected you by warning and blaming.",
      "instructions": "calm, low; warm and steady; wise, slow; soft emphasis on 'I am your shadow'",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"

    {
      "text": "You were loud? I thought shadows were just... dark. They feel like weights that pull me back.",

    {
      "text": "Yes. When I was a boy I pointed to every scar and said, 'Don't cross — you'll get hurt.' I kept you safe, but I also drew the map of every stopped step.",

      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },

      "text": "So how do I stop being ruled by that map? How do I befriend you without losing my way?",

    {
      "text": "Three small acts. Pause — stop the automatic rush. Name the feeling — fear, shame, anger. Thank me for trying to protect you. Then choose: does this urge point toward love, or toward an old fear?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Invite it close. Hold its hand and say, 'I see you. You kept me alive. I will not abandon you, but you won't drive today.' Integration turns your shadow into the needle of your compass — honest, not tyrant.",

      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "Try this now: pause for one breath, name whatever rises, thank the part that showed up, then make one small choice that aligns with who you want to be. Share a moment in the comments when you followed your inner compass — or ask a question. Your story could be someone's map.",
      "instructions": "inviting and upbeat; warm call to action; slightly quicker tempo to close; friendly",
