    {
      "text": "Because it's been shoved into the dark for so long it learned to shout to be seen. Shadows protect what we once couldn't hold.",

      "text": "You don't fight it; you befriend it. Fight is what taught it to hide. Friendship asks it to speak and listens without judgment.",

      "text": "Winning isn't the point. The Inner Work is learning the language of your pain. Name it. Ask it what it needs. Hold the space without fixing it for others.",

      "text": "Begin now. Give five breaths to one shadow, name the feeling, offer one sentence of kindness. Then share what you discover—here, below, or with someone you trust. Your inner journey will change the outer world; tell us what it taught you.",
