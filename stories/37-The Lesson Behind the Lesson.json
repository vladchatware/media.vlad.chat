    {
      "text": "Why does my shadow always show up right when I'm trying to be 'better'? It's like it ruins everything.",
      "instructions": "young, curious, uncertain; quick inhale at start; soft, boyish tone; rising intonation on 'better'",

    {
      "text": "Because the shadow is not the enemy you're trying to beat—it's the part of you that's been wounded and shouting for attention.",

      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "So should I ignore it? Pretend it's not there and keep trying to be good?",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "No. Ignoring is what keeps it louder. Imagine it's a child inside you banging pots—ignoring means the pots only get louder. Listening lets you learn why the child is crying.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Start small: breathe, name the feeling, ask the shadow what it needs, then thank it for protecting you. That acknowledgement loosens the old grip. The hero's journey Joseph Campbell spoke of? It begins here—inside.",

      "text": "Once there was a boy who locked his anger in a closet because it scared him. Years later he opened the door, sat with the anger, and learned it was tired, not monstrous. When he sat with it, the room filled with light. The anger eased. The boy became wholeer—not because it vanished, but because he stopped pretending it wasn't part of him.",
      "instructions": "storytelling warmth; reflective; rising then gentle resolve at the end",

    {
      "text": "The lesson behind the lesson is that every unwelcome part holds a message. Integrate it, and you reclaim energy wasted on resistance. You stop performing goodness and start living from wholeness. That is freedom.",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Tonight: sit for five slow breaths. Invite the shadow to speak. Name one feeling, forgive yourself for hiding it, and do one small act of kindness for that inner part—listen, draw, write a note. Share what you learn or ask for help. Start tiny; keep returning. If this touched you, pause and reflect. Then tell us in the comments—what did your shadow ask for?",
      "instructions": "warm, concise, motivational; calm authority; friendly call to action; inviting tone",
