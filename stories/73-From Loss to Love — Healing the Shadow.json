    {
      "text": "Why did you turn away from me just now? I felt small—like something inside me was taken.",
      "instructions": "young boy voice, trembling but curious; medium pace; rising intonation at the question; vulnerable emotional range; no whisper.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "I did not turn away to punish you. I reflected the place you avoid—the hurt you call loss. When you look at me like that, you see an old story, not the truth of who you are.",
      "instructions": "soft, low tone; calm and steady; gentle cadence; compassionate; slow enough for listeners to absorb.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "It hurt anyway. My chest felt hollow. How do I stop feeling like I'm missing something every time you don't notice me?",
      "instructions": "small, pained; quick inhale before speaking; honest, slightly rushed; rising and falling intonation showing confusion and hurt.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Because that hollow is an echo of a wound called rejection. It tells you that love must come from outside. But love's true home is inside you. I—your shadow—show you what you still need to welcome and forgive.",
      "instructions": "steady, explanatory; warm; deliberate pauses between phrases; reassuring and wise; moderate speed.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "So if you are the wound, why do I feel so alone when you ignore me?",
      "instructions": "soft, searching; quieter; slower; earnest curiosity; slight falter at the end.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "You feel alone because you were taught to look outward for belonging. The inner work asks you to turn inward and cradle that lonely part. Notice the pain, name it, breathe with it. When you stop chasing approval, you can offer approval to yourself.",
      "instructions": "encouraging; soothing cadence; calm certainty; medium-slow; a compassionate smile in the voice.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "Okay—I'll try. (breathes) This ache... it's real. I can say to myself: I see you, you aren't alone. I choose love instead of the old story.",
      "instructions": "hesitant then firmer; breathy inhale audible; growing steady confidence; soft triumph at the end.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes. Each time you welcome your hurt with kindness, the shadow softens and becomes ally instead of enemy. Love isn't ignoring pain; it's leaning into it and holding it until it relaxes into peace.",
      "instructions": "warm, approving; gentle crescendo; slow and spacious; calming reassurance; imagine a hand on the boy's shoulder.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "I feel lighter already—like a room opened in me where I thought only emptiness lived. Is this peace the true thing everyone talks about?",
      "instructions": "brightening tone; surprised wonder; quickened but steady pace; hopeful inflection at the end.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "This is the beginning of it. The journey back to your true Self starts here, in small choices to love rather than react. The shadow will still visit, but now you can greet it and guide it home.",
      "instructions": "gentle finality; calm and inspiring; steady rhythm; slight uplift on last sentence.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "I will remember that I am not missing—I'm becoming. Thank you for staying with me, even when you were only a shadow.",
      "instructions": "soft gratitude; peaceful; warm closure; slow, contented cadence.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Keep practicing. When pain rises, breathe, name it, and offer yourself the love you seek. If this touched you, pause for a breath now and share one small way you'll choose love today in the comments—your words might be the light someone else needs.",
      "instructions": "inviting, calm encouragement; clear call to action; gentle persuasive tone; moderate speed; warm closing smile in voice.",
