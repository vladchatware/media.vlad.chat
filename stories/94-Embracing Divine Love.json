      "text": "Why does it feel like there's a darkness living inside me? Like I'm two people.",
      "instructions": "Onyx: Childlike curiosity, breathy, hesitant; quiet urgency; slightly fast when anxious.",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Because that 'darkness' is your shadow — all the hurts, fears and stories you tucked away. It arrived to protect you in the only way it knew.",
      "instructions": "Ash: Deep, resonant, calm; compassionate tone; slow, deliberate pacing; warm resonance.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "Protect me? It only shames me. When I shove it away it gets louder, angrier.",

      "voice": "onyx"

    {
      "text": "Pushing makes the wound roar. The inner work is simple and brave: look, name, feel, forgive. Invite that part in like a frightened child at your door.",

    {
      "text": "You are not broken. You're whole and learning. Try this: say, 'I see you. I'm here.' Breathe with it. Love doesn't force — it welcomes and heals.",

      "text": "I... I see you. I'm here. I'm sorry you were hurt.",

      "voice": "onyx"

    {
      "text": "Listen. When the shadow speaks, listen without judgment. It will tell the story of why it protects. Hearing it dissolves its power to wound.",
      "instructions": "Ash: Gentle, attentive; patient cadence; almost like guiding someone to listen to a heartbeat.",

      "text": "That loosened weight is freedom. Divine love isn't a distant prize — it's the home you rediscover when you embrace every part of yourself.",

      "voice": "ash"

      "text": "So healing is choosing myself, even the parts I'm scared of?",

      "voice": "onyx"

    {
      "text": "Yes. Keep showing up with curiosity and compassion. Small, honest acts — a breath, a welcome, a forgiveness — transform the landscape of your inner life.",
      "instructions": "Ash: Kind, encouraging; closing with quiet authority; gentle tempo to leave space.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"

    {
      "text": "Breathe now. Share one thing you noticed in your shadow today in the comments — or simply sit with this: where might love be waiting for you?",
