    {
      "text": "Why do I keep chasing people's nods and likes like my worth depends on them?",
      "instructions": "Youthful, breathy, urgent. Slight tremor in voice, rising intonation on the question. Fast pace, vulnerable.",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Because once, someone decided you weren't enough, and you learned to trade yourself for their approval.",

    {
      "text": "I act perfect, say what I think they want… but afterwards I feel hollow, like I'm borrowing joy.",

    {
      "text": "Approval became your safety rope. It kept you safe in storms, but the rope tied you to other people's weather.",

    {
      "text": "Not by forcing bravery. By befriending the part that clings—the shadow that learned to ask for approval to survive.",

      "text": "Yes. Start small: name the fear — 'I'll be abandoned', 'I'm not enough.' Let the shadow speak. Then answer from your heart: 'You are seen. You are whole.'",

      "instructions": "Resonant, slightly uplifting. Quicken on 'hero's journey' for emphasis, then slow and reverent on the last sentence. Quote-like clarity.",
