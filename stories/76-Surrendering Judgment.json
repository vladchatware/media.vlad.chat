      "text": "Why do I keep judging myself and everyone around me? It feels like a shadow that follows me everywhere.",

    {
      "text": "Because judgment is your shadow trying to keep you safe. It learned a language long ago—blame, comparison, critique—to protect a wounded part of you.",

      "text": "My shadow talks so loud. It makes me angry and then ashamed. How do I make it quiet?",

      "text": "You don't make it quiet by fighting it. You listen. Befriending the shadow means turning judgment into curiosity. Ask: 'What are you protecting? What do you need?'.",

      "text": "So when I judge someone else, it's really about me? That feels... embarrassing.",

      "voice": "onyx"

    {
      "text": "Often yes. Judgment is projection—your hurt dressed as certainty. Naming it removes the spell. Practice: notice the judgment, name the feeling behind it, breathe, and ask the shadow its story.",

    {
      "text": "Truth can be seen without harshness. Distinguish observation from condemnation. Speak with clarity, not with the loudness of your wound. That is the difference between helping and hurting.",

      "text": "Exactly. Each time you choose curiosity over being right, you heal a piece of that shadow. The relationship shifts from battle to dialogue. Little by little, freedom grows.",

      "side": "right",

      "text": "I can do that. I want my shadow to be my friend, not my enemy.",

      "text": "When you surrender judgment, you reclaim presence. You learn to meet yourself and others with honesty wrapped in compassion. Keep practicing—each gentle answer is freedom earned.",
