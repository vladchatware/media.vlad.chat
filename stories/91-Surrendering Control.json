    {
      "text": "How do I stop trying to control everything? I thought being in charge would make me safe, but it just feels heavy.",
      "instructions": "young boy voice, tentative, small breath at start, rising intonation on questions, slow pacing, a hint of panic shifting to curiosity",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Control tried to keep you whole by closing you down. I am that voice—your shadow—built from fear and the need to protect. But protection became prison.",

      "text": "So you were trying to help? I hate that I pushed people away. I thought I was safe when I tightened the ropes.",

      "voice": "onyx"

    {
      "text": "You did help—once. But time froze the pattern. Surrender isn't giving up power; it's handing it back to yourself with wiser hands. Try this: name the fear, breathe it in, and let it have a seat beside you.",

      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"

      "text": "Name it… okay. I'm afraid of being taken advantage of, of being hurt again.",

      "voice": "onyx"

      "text": "Good. Now breathe with that fear. Feel where it tightens in your chest. Thank it for trying to keep you safe, then ask it: 'What would you like instead?' Listen.",

    {
      "text": "It says it wants trust—but not the reckless kind. It wants proof we can survive being open.",

      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Then give it small proofs. Choose one tiny place to loosen the grip today—say yes to a small risk, ask for help once, or apologize where pride holds you. Watch the shadow relax when you survive the breath.",

      "voice": "onyx"

    {
      "text": "Surrender is not losing yourself to chaos—it's choosing trust over compulsive control. Your shadow becomes ally when you meet it with curiosity, not warfare. Try the small step, notice what softens, and let your heart learn it can hold both fear and courage.",
      "instructions": "teacher, wise and warm, concluding tone with gentle emphasis on 'curiosity' and 'ally', slow, resonant",

    {
      "text": "I let the rope loosen a little. It feels… lighter. Maybe I can breathe between the knots now.",

      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Then keep loosening, not by force but by small acts of trust. If this spoke to you, take one tiny thing to release today and share it below — or simply reflect: what would surrender look like for you?",
      "instructions": "teacher, warm invitation, gentle and upbeat, clear call to action, empathetic closing",
      "side": "right",
