      "text": "That warmth is the beginning. The hero's journey is inside you — a call, small but true. Your shadow isn't an enemy; it's a library of unspoken hurts and hidden gifts. If you try to burn it away, you lose the pages you need to read.",

      "text": "But how do I read it without getting lost in the stories? I'm scared I'll find only shame.",
