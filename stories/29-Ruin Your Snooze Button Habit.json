      "text": "First, relax—this isn’t a willpower failure, it’s sleep inertia and habit design. If you want to ruin the snooze habit, you redesign the morning so snoozing becomes inconvenient and unappealing.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Because friction and momentum beat motivation. Moving the alarm adds friction to snoozing. The tiny action creates immediate feedback—your brain gets a small win, which makes the next step easier. Use a 5-second rule: count backward from five and act before your mind talks you out of it.",

    {
      "text": "Yes—commit publicly: tell a friend or post a one-line promise. Put your phone on a single loud alarm (no snooze), place something you need—glasses, workout shoes—next to it. Move bedtime 15 minutes earlier and reward yourself with one small treat after three consecutive mornings. I learned this after missing an important audition once; the cost of snoozing woke me up to fixing the system.",
