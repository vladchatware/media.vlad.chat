    {
      "text": "What is the Mirror of Awareness? Why does my shadow keep following me everywhere?",
      "instructions": "Youthful curiosity, slightly breathless, quick pace, innocent tone, edges of worry, clear enunciation.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "It is the quiet place inside you that sees what you hide. Your shadow follows because it was carrying what you could not hold as a child—fear, shame, a story of being not enough.",
      "instructions": "Deep, warm, steady, compassionate, slow pacing, gentle emphasis on 'sees' and 'hide'.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "Sometimes it feels like it wants to hurt me, or stop me from trying. I push it away, but it only gets louder.",
      "instructions": "Small panic, vulnerable, faster rhythm then softening, voice wobble, pleading.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Pushing only makes a child hide deeper. The shadow’s loudness is its calling for attention. It learned to shout to be seen and protected—so it learned the language of alarm.",
      "instructions": "Calm explanation, patient cadence, sympathetic undertone, quiet authority, moderate speed.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "How do I make it quiet? How do I make it my friend instead of my enemy?",
      "instructions": "Hopeful, searching, softer now, slower breath between phrases, earnest tone.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Begin with three small things: look, name, breathe. Look without blame. Name the feeling like a label—'fear', 'not enough'. Breathe into it so the body knows you are present. Then, thank it for trying to protect you and choose a tiny action that contradicts its warning.",
      "instructions": "Instructional, rhythmic, deliberate pauses between steps, soothing cadence, encouraging tone.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "Okay... I’ll try. I notice the tightness in my chest. I name it: 'Not enough.'",
      "instructions": "Tentative, quieter, measured, a small crack of relief in the voice, slow pace.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Breathe with that name. Inhale to the chest, exhale and say, 'I see you.' Keep your gaze gentle—like meeting a scared animal. No sudden moves.",
      "instructions": "Warm whisper, guiding, slow tempo, intimate, slight echo to suggest inner space.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "I breathed. It didn’t scream. It looked tired, like someone who’s been carrying a sack too heavy for years.",
      "instructions": "Soft wonder, relief, surprised smile audible, steadying breath, hopeful tone.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Exactly. When you let it rest in your awareness, its weight changes. It becomes an ally that points to where you’ve been hurt—and to where you can be healed. Integration, not exile, is the key.",
      "instructions": "Affirming, luminous, steady, heartfelt, building warmth into a concise teaching.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "So my shadow won’t disappear, but it can stop sabotaging me?",
      "instructions": "Curious, cautious optimism, quicker rhythm, seeking reassurance.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "It won’t vanish—that part of you holds a story that deserves care. But it will stop controlling choices when you learn to see it, name it, and respond with compassion. Freedom comes from befriending what you feared, not from fighting it.",
      "instructions": "Resolute warmth, calm conviction, gentle uplift in the last sentence, moderate pacing.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
    },
    {
      "text": "I can do that. One look, one name, one breath at a time.",
      "instructions": "Quiet confidence, small brave smile in voice, steady, short cadence.",
      "side": "left",
      "voice": "onyx"
    },
    {
      "text": "Try this for one minute today: find the tight place, name it, breathe, and say aloud, 'I see you.' Notice what shifts. If you want, share what your shadow told you in the comments—your story can help someone else begin their inner work.",
      "instructions": "Inviting, warm, gentle urgency, encouraging, soft uplift at the end, clear call to action.",
      "side": "right",
      "voice": "ash"
