    {
      "text": "How do I face my shadow without being swallowed by it? I'm scared it'll win.",

    {
      "text": "The shadow doesn't want to win you — it wants to be seen. It's a frightened part of you, holding old pain and protective strategies.",

    {
      "text": "But it shows me my worst parts: anger, shame, the things I hide. I feel ashamed of being ashamed.",
      "instructions": "Onyx: small, rushed at first then faltering; honest shame; voice cracks slightly; quick inhale before 'I feel'.",

      "text": "Begin with small acts: pause and breathe, notice the sensation, name the feeling, ask it what it needs, then offer kindness — no fixing, just listening.",

      "text": "Yes. When you welcome what you rejected, you reclaim the energy used to hide. You're doing the bravest work: returning home to yourself.",

    {
      "text": "Five minutes of honest listening each morning: sit, breathe, name what surfaces, and say one kind sentence to that part — 'I see you, you are safe with me.' Small repetitions build a new way of being.",
