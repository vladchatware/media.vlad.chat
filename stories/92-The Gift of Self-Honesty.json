      "text": "Because you are. But the one you're fighting is not an enemy—it's a wounded part of you that learned to survive. Calling it 'the shadow' doesn't make it evil; it makes it someone who hasn't been heard.",

      "text": "None of those. You begin with honesty. Not to punish yourself, but to name what hurts. Naming takes the power out of mystery. It brings the wound into the light where it can be tended.",

    {
      "text": "Fear is part of the wound asking to be seen. Self-honesty isn't an attack—it's an offering. When you can say, 'I'm afraid' instead of pretending you're fine, the shadow stops defending and starts listening.",

      "text": "Start with one small truth. A single thought you usually hide—'I worry I'm not enough,' or 'I get angry because I feel unseen.' Sit with it without fixing it. Ask, 'What does this part need from me?'",
